This file provides comments and documentation to the file "explain.json".
There are values in explain.json that you need to specify 
for the operation of your "explain" server.

Why this file?  
Because JSON does not support comments, the specification for
JSON format specifically excludes comments, 
JSON files may only to contain data.  See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-comment-a-json-file

title               => This is not used, as far as I recall.
secret              => This is used to encrypt cookie with
                       username/password. So it should be long, random
                       string.
database.dsn        => the standard connection information 
                       A) database name (case sensitive), 
                       B) server or host 
                       C) port - standard port for postgresql is 5432
database.username   => you created this when you set up a role in
                       postgresql for this explain server
database.password   => the password for database.username (optional)

mail_sender.from    => From to be used by mails sent by contact form
mail_sender.to      => Address which should receive mails sent by
                       contact form
mail_sender.subject => Subject for mails from contact form

hypnotoad.pid_file  => /var/run is the standard place to store your pid
                       files; if you do not have access to /var/run,
                       then create in your home directory a branch
                       var/run and place it there. Example
                       ~/var/run/explain.pid. Make sure you create the
                       directories, ~/var/run, before specifying this
                       alternate location.
