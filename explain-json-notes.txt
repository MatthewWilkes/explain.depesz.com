This file provides comments and documentation to the file "explain.json".
There are values in explain.json that you need to specify 
for the operation of your "explain" server.

Why this file?  
Because JSON does not support comments, the specification for
JSON format specifically excludes comments, 
JSON files may only to contain data.  See

hypnotoad.pid_file = /var/run is the standard place to store your pid files; 
		   if you do not have access to /var/run, 
		   then create in your home directory a branch
		   var/run and place it there.  
		   Example ~/var/run/explain.pid.  
		   Make sure you create the directories, 
		   ~/var/run, before specifying this alternate location.
